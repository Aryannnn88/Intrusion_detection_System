# IntrusionDetection_System
I utilized a range of machine learning algorithms to detect different types of network intrusions using the KDD-99 dataset. This process involved training and testing models to analyze network traffic data, identify suspicious patterns, and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of intrusion detection systems.
